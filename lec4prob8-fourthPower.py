# Lecture 4, Problem 8

##Write a Python function, fourthPower, that takes in one number and
##returns that value raised to the fourth power.
##
##You should use the square procedure that you defined in Problem 3 of
##these lecture exercises (you don't need to redefine square in this box;
##when you call square, the tutor will use our definition).
##
##This function takes in one number and returns one number.

def fourthPower(x):
    '''
    x: int or float.
